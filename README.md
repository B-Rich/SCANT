# SingleCellTranscriptEvidence

## Introduction
The analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data involves the use of a disparate set of software packages to identify the genes that are expressed within the sample. Although sophisticated software packages are now just a click away from being employed for these analyses, they expect the user to string the outputs from one step of the analyses to the next piece of software. We address this challenge by creating a pipeline that brings together a set of well-tested tools and combines them into a single script that is simple and easy-to-use. The pipeline described here allows users to analyze data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) by providing just the BioProject accession or specific run identifiers in combination with HISAT2 index files for the genome of interest. Upon execution, this pipeline identifies sequencing reads that correspond to novel genes that are yet to be annotated.

## Workflow
![Workflow](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/SingleCellTranscriptEvidence/blob/master/workflow.jpg)


## Setup
### System
Depending on the amount of the data being analyzed, the pipeline can require a significant amount of computational resources. We recommend using a computer that has at least 8 processor cores, 16 Gb of RAM and approximately 1.5 Gb hard drive space for each analyzed run. Additional disk space is needed for one or more HISAT2 index files.
### Software Packages
The pipeline expects the following packages are installed and available in the PATH:
* Python (version 3.5 or above)
* [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) (version 2.1.0)
* [StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/) (version 1.3.3b)
* [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) (version 1.3.1)
### Data files
HISAT2 index files are required for the genome of interest to execute the script. For a selected list of organisms, pre-computed index files can be downloaded from (ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/hisat2/data/). Alternately, HISAT2 index files can be generated by the user by using the `hisat2-build` tool that is packaged with the HISAT2 software. For instructions on how to build indexes, please refer to the [HISAT2 manual](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/manual.shtml).


## Usage
